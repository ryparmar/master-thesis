# Experimental Repositories
This is an experimental repository, which is still relatively untidy. A neater version will hopefully be available here https://github.com/ryparmar/master-thesis soon.

## DrQA
DrQA implementation of TF-IDF experiments.


## Anserini
Experimenting with Anserini library, which provides very efficient implementation of BM25 and TF-IDF algorithms. 
These models provide very solid baseline for information retrieval like tasks. Results are compared with 
DRQA implementation.


## Claims Quality Metrics
Simple library for computation of data (generated claims) quality metrics according to https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.fever-1.6.pdf.


## ColBERT
ColBERT is a _fast_ and _accurate_ retrieval model, enabling scalable BERT-based search over large text collections in tens of milliseconds.

Forked from https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT/

## Pretraining on ICT and BFS tasks
Code for pretraining mBERT with "Inverse Cloze Task (ICT)" and "Body First Selection (BFS)
